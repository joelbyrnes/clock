This is a 24 hour clock divided into hour segments, which can have time periods set to represent activities - sleep, work, etc.
Time that has passed is shadowed out, showing you how much time is left in the day and for the activities.
The idea is to get a view of how much time is left in the day, at a glance.

This is my first android application, so I'm probably doing a lot of things badly. I would appreciate constructive criticism.

=TO DO=
* make it a widget
* add other clocks (tomorrow? year?) which can be swiped to
* make it scale properly
* allow programming in periods via app instead of hardcoding, saved locally
* allow segments to be tapped for more info or other actions - at the moment it's just a flat image, is this a bad way to do it?


=Far off future to do=
* calendar integration
